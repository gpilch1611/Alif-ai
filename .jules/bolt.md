**Learning:** This application uses a pattern where every input event triggers a full UI re-render and expensive filtering over large data sets (like 114 surahs or 99 names). This is particularly impactful because the app is stateless and re-generates DOM from strings frequently.
**Action:** Always debounce search/filter inputs to at least 200ms to avoid CPU spikes and main thread lag during typing.
